#     the ability to use DDL sub-lan so statements like Create, Drop, Alter table

#     create:  It will automatically DROP all existing Table and other schema that is mapped by annotations on our models
#               the will re-create those tables at runtime of our application

#     update:  will not alter any existing schema but will create new tables if needed

#     validate:  it will check to make sure the schema exists as expected but does not create new tables

#     none:  it will not alter or create tables
